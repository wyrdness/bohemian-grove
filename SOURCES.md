## Research Notes

### Credibility Assessment

**High Credibility**:
- G. William Domhoff's academic research
- Historical records of club founding and property
- Mainstream media coverage
- First-hand member accounts (limited)

**Medium Credibility**:
- Activist and protest documentation
- Leaked photos and limited video
- Secondary journalistic sources

**Low Credibility**:
- Extreme conspiracy theory claims
- Unverified anonymous accounts
- Heavily edited or interpreted footage

### Access Limitations

Most primary sources about Grove activities are inaccessible due to:
- Private club status
- Member confidentiality agreements
- Lack of public records
- Security measures

This information vacuum creates space for both legitimate questions and unfounded speculation.
