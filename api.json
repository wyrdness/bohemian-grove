While the club and ceremonies are real, conspiracy claims of satanic rituals and Illuminati meetings are largely unfounded exaggerations.",
      "full": "Bohemian Grove is a 2,700-acre campground owned by the private Bohemian Club, located near Monte Rio, California. Founded in 1872, the club hosts an annual two-week summer encampment attended by some of the most powerful men in politics, business, and the arts. While members engage in theatrical performances, lectures, and networking, the secretive nature of the gatherings has fueled conspiracy theories ranging from satanic rituals to world government planning. The reality appears to be a male bonding retreat with theatrical traditions, most notably the 'Cremation of Care' ceremony featuring a 40-foot owl effigy."
